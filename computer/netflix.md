## Practical [[API]] [[Design]] at Netflix, Part 1: Using [[Protobuf]] [[FieldMask]]

By default, [[gRPC]] uses protobuf as its [[IDL]] ([[Interface Definition Language]]) and data serialization protocol.

[[FieldMask]] is a protobuf message. There are a number of utilities and conventions on how to use this message when it is present in an [[RPC]] request. A FieldMask message contains a single field named paths, which is used to specify fields that should be returned by a read operation or modified by an update operation.

```proto
message FieldMask {
  // The set of field mask paths.
  repeated string paths = 1;
}
```

[[FieldMask]] is used for:
- Masking name of field by field number.
- Masking message fields
- Can ship pre-built fields

Limitations
- Using FieldMask can limit your ability to rename message fields (described in the Protobuf Field Names vs Field Numbers section of the article)
- Repeated fields are only allowed in the last position of a path string. This means you cannot select (mask) individual sub-fields in a message inside a list. This can change in the foreseeable future, as a recently approved Google API Improvement Proposal AIP-161 Field masks includes support for wildcards on repeated fields.
