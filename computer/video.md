## Glossary

[[Frame]]: a static picture on the screen.

[[Frame size]]: resolution of a frame, unit is pixel.

[[Frame rate]]: the number of frames presented on screen per second.

[[Encoding]]: is the process of digitization of analog video streams.

[[Transcoding]]: is the conversion between different file formats.

[[Codec]]: is the program that is responsible for the encoding and compression of video and [[audio]] tracks.

[[H.264]] aka [[AVC]] ([[Advanced Video Coding]]) by the [[MPEG]] group is internets current popular codec. This codec is widely supported by most mobile devices, web browsers, and operating system vendors thankfully requiring many different formats for playback like the old days.

[[Mp3]] by [[MPEG]] group and [[AAC]] ([[Advanced Audio Coding]]) by Apple are the most popular audio codec on the internet. Since the mp3 patents have expired AAC is being recommended. 

A newer video codec [[H.265]] aka [[High-Efficiency Video Coding]] or [[HEVC]] is now available as the successor of the H.264 codec

Containers: Often called file formats such as MP4, MOV, AVI, WMV, MKV, and WebM. There are a lot of different container formats. MP4 is very popular on the web and WebM is an open container format being actively promoted by Google for royalty-free internet use. 

[[HDR]]: High dynamic range. Modern TVs and cameras are able to capture greater details of images and video in senses that contain brighter and dark objects

## Formulas

`File size` = `Bitrate of bot Video and Audio`/8 * `duration` * `compress ratio`

`Bitrate` = `Frame size` * `Frames rate`

`Frame size` = `Resolution` * `Color Depth`
