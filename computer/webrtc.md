# WebRTC

## Peer to Peer (P2P)

[[P2P]] or [[Mesh]] is the easiest way to set up and most cost-effective architecture that you can use in a WebRTC application; it's also the least scalable. In this topology, two or more peers (clients) talk to each other directly or via a TURN server withch relays audio, video and data streaming to them.

This topology provides the best end-to-end encryption because it doesn't depend on a centralized server.

```mermaid

    id1((Peer 1))
    id2((Peer 2))
    id3((Peer 3))
    id1 --> id2
    id1 --> id3
    id2 --> id1
    id2 --> id3
    id3 --> id1
    id3 --> id2
```

Advantages
- Easy to set up using a basic WebRTC implementation
- Better privacy
- Cost-effective because it doesnâ€™t require a media server

Drawbacks
- Can connect only a small number of participants without noticeable decline in streaming quality
- CPU intensive because the processing of streams is offloaded to each peer
