# Service instance per VM

## Context

You have applied the [[Microservice architecture]] pattern and architected your system as a set of services. Each service is deployed as a set of service instances for throughput and availability.

## Problem

How are services packaged and deployed?

## Forces

- Services are written using a variety of languages, frameworks, and framework versions
- Each service consists of multiple service instances for throughput and availability
- Service must be independently deployable and scalable
- Service instances need to be isolated from one another
- You need to be able to quickly build and deploy a service
- You need to be able to constrain the resources (CPU and memory) consumed by a service
- You need to monitor the behavior of each service instance
- You want deployment to reliable
- You must deploy the application as cost-effectively as possible

## Solution

Package the service as a virtual machine image and deploy each service instance as a separate VM

## Examples

Netflix packages each service as an EC2 AMI and deploys each service instance as a EC2 instance.

## Resulting context

The benefits of this approach include:
- Its straightforward to scale the service by increasing the number of instances. Amazon Autoscaling Groups can even do this automatically based on load.
- The VM encapsulates the details of the technology used to build the service. All services are, for example, started and stopped in exactly the same way.
- Each service instance is isolated
- A VM imposes limits on the CPU and memory consumed by a service instance
- IaaS solutions such as AWS provide a mature and feature rich infrastructure for deploying and managing virtual machines. For example,
  - [[Elastic Load Balancer]]
  - Autoscaling groups
  - â€¦

The drawbacks of this approach include:
- Building a VM image is slow and time consuming
