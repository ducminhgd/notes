## Channels

A channel is a representation of sound coming from or going to a single point. A single microphone can produce one channel of audio, and a single speaker can accept one channel of audio.

There are two types of audio channel. Standard audio channels are used to present the majority of the audible sound.

## Lossless vs Lossy

Lossless audio is used in the event where you want to use the original data in a file. Compression algorithms preserve audio data so the audio is exactly the same as the original source. 

This differs from lossy audio formats such as AAC, MP3, and WMA, which compress audio using algorithms that get rid of data.

Audio files are created by silences and sounds. Lossless formats are able to compress the silences to almost zero space while keeping all of the sound data.
