# Flour

## Wheat

I know three types of wheat flour in Vietnam: 8, 11 and 13. It is defined based on gluten and protein content. [[Protein]] contained in flour will become [[Gluten]] when flour is mixed with water. The lesser gluten, the smoother the product becomes.
- Number 8 ([[Pastry Flour]]) is for making foam [[cake]]s, cakes, [[muffin]]s, [[waffle]]s, [[dumpling]]s.
- Number 11 ([[Bread Flour]]) is for making [[pan cake]]s, [[sandwich]]es, [[tart]]s, [[pizza]]s, [[cup cake]]s.
- Number 13 ([[Bread Flour]]) is for making sandwiches, [[baguette]]s, [[doughnut]]s, tarts, pizzas, [[croissant]]s.
