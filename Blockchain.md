## Token

The "token": blockchainâ€™s most powerful and most misunderstood tool.

A [[token]] is a representation of something in the blockchain. This something can be money, time, services, shares in a company, a virtual pet, anything. By representing things as tokens, we can allow smart contracts to interact with them, exchange them, create or destroy them.
